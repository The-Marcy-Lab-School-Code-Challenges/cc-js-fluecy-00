# Code Challenge: JavaScript Fluency 

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to AWS Cloud9. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Description of the Problem
0. Why does the statement `[1, 3, 5] === [1, 3, 5]` evaluate to `false`?

1. Write a function named `onlyOdd` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array consisting of only the odd numbers.


2. Write a function named `reverseWord` that takes a string and returns the string with its characters in reverse. You may use built-in methods. 

3. Write a function called `average` that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of the numbers.

4. Write a function called `removeVowels` that takes a string and returns the string with all vowels (upper and lowercase) removed.

5. Write a function called `makeUpper` that takes an array of words and returns a new array with all of the original words uppercased.

6. Write a function called `isAllTruthy` that takes an array and returns `true` only if ALL elements in the array are truthy.

### Bonus

7. Create an object called `player` based on your favorite athlete. Add a `name` property, an `age` property, a `sport` property, and a method called `sayName` that logs the player's name to the console.

8. Loop over an object and log all properties and values to the console.
